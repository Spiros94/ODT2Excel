ODT2Excel
=========

Python based script that translates ODT files to Excel readable files

Installation
--------------

You will also need XlsxWriter (https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.org/) and Tk for python (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) in order to get it work.


You can also compile it with py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/). Setup.py in the py2exe folder will help you do that simply by running the command from your terminal:
```sh
python setup.py py2exe
```

(remember to transfer the setup.py file where the odt2excel.py is)
